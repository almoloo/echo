## üîç Overview

Echo is an AI-powered widget designed specifically for Lukso Universal Profiles, creating personalized digital assistants that authentically represent profile owners in the Lukso ecosystem. By answering AI-generated questions across categories like career, identity, and connection, profile owners train a dedicated assistant that engages with visitors on their behalf.

This innovative widget serves as a digital concierge for your Universal Profile, allowing visitors to ask questions, send messages, or donate LYX directly through the interface. When the assistant encounters questions it can't answer, it logs them for the profile owner to review later, continuously improving the experience over time.

Echo includes a comprehensive analytics dashboard where profile owners can monitor visitor interactions, including device information, geographic location, and visitor profile details (when available). During its beta phase, Echo is completely free for Lukso Universal Profile owners.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Personal AI Assistant**: Train an AI assistant that represents you through guided questions about your career, identity, and connections, combined with your public profile data.
- **Visitor Engagement**: Allow visitors to ask questions, send messages, or donate LYX directly through an intuitive widget interface.
- **Continuous Learning**: Any questions the assistant can't answer are logged for review, helping you improve your digital representation over time.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Access comprehensive analytics including visitor metrics (device, location, profile info when available) and unanswered question logs.
- **Universal Profile Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Lukso Universal Profiles, leveraging blockchain authentication and transaction capabilities.
- **Free Beta Access**: Use all features completely free during the beta phase.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Echo uses a modular architecture that combines AI technologies with blockchain capabilities. The widget embeds into Universal Profiles through a lightweight iFrame page, while the core services handle data processing, AI training, and blockchain interactions.
